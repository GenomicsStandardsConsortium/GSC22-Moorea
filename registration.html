                <h5> REGISTRATION</h5>
                <p> Full details of how to register will be added here when they are available </p>
				<p> Virtual attendees will be required to register to gain access to the "live" sessions, but where possible, talks will be made openly available soon after the event.<br>
				Due to the limited size of the facilities in person attendance will be by invitation only, but those registering for virtual attendance will be able to express interest in physical attendance (at short notice) in the event that spaces are available after the invitations have all been sent out. In that scenario places will be offered on a first-come first-served basis.<p>
